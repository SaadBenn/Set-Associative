# set-associative
Simulating set associative cache with different cache organizations


This program simulates a set-associative cache. It is given a cache line size specified in bytes, the number of lines(N)
in the cache,and the degree of cache associativity (1, 2, 4, 8,...,N), the program will simulate the behaviour of the 
corresponding cache and return the number of hits and misses seen when  processing a  sequence  of  address  references  
generated  by  a  program  running  on the CPU.
